            <h2 class="ap1">AN APP ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>This project was the first thing I did when I started my studies. It is an assignment where we need to design a prototype of an app that will describe us and show who we are. We were asked to use Adobe XD to make it. <p>
            I thought about creating a prototype that would really show what I like and people could already have an idea of who I am before meeting me. I created an environment in space since I am passionate about space and universes and included different parts of me in planets. As you can see there were four planets in my universe, each of them had quite some information about what I like and who I was.

            <p>The Bespoke project was also part of my study. It consisted in creating gift giving experience for a specific user. We first had to do a research about our user before designing the prototype. <p>
            I designed a game to chose between two options in order to design your gift when playing the actual game. I created the prototype using Adobe XD.

            <p>This project was part of my study. It consisted in teaching us the basics of coding. We used Processing 3.0 to learn and practice. We were asked to create assignments by applying the content of IRL classes. The project displayed here is my final project for that course. We had to mix up all the knowledge we acquired during the course to create one final project. </p> 
            I decided to create something that would rotate on itself. I used an image of a thunder and made it rotate infinitely on itself. I tried to use all the commands weâ€™ve learned to create it.
