            <h1>DESIGN STATEMENT</h1>
            <div>Hello, I'm Leo, I am an intercultural UX designer living in the Netherlands, in the Hague. I am currently 20 years old, and I am following a bachelorâ€™s degree in Communication and Multimedia Design in The Hague University of Applied Sciences. <p>
            Creativity is my best competence which is why I am good at designing brand new products. I get my inspiration outside, in our world, but also in my head, in my own world. I use my creativity to design digital experiences to offer a unique experience to my users.
            <p>I love the aesthetic side when designing and I focus on making it unique. My goal as a designer is creating efficient and attractive sites, applications and experiences for brands or users.
            <p><p>I speak five different languages so it will be easy to contact me! Feel free to reach out if you want to know more.
